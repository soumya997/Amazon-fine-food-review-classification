Now you will think what is reapting here? Here reapting reffers to the reapting structurre of RNNs. There are different kind of data avilable, like normal tabular data with different features,image data,time series data, text data etc. From them time series data and text data are the data which has a sequence in it.Let me discuss the meaning of sequence for text data. It's very noticeable that every sentance has a sequence of words, and if you change the sequence of that sentance then the sentance wont has same meaning. Because of this reason we cant use MLPs on text data (there are other reasons too like large parameter size,size of i/p word and o/p word can be different etc.).\nNow, a RNN have many structure as per the problem requirments like- one to one, one to many,many to one,many to many as fig 1.\n<br>\n<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AtbnrWR.jpg\" width=\"500px\"></center>\n<br>\n\nBut, here i will be discussing many to one network.But, keep in mind that a single RNN cell is same in every where, just they are placed in different ways to satisfy the problem requirments.\n\n###  Many to One RNN: \nThe structure of a many to many looks like fig2.Application of many to one networks are spam detection, sentiment analysis etc. Now lets dive deep and understand the bare bones of RNN.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wLyS5M9.png\" width=\"600px\"></center>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Every vertical block with input and output arrows is called a RNN cell, at the beginning it uses a vector with zeros which is named here as $O_0$, this is only for showing the repeating structure of RNN. the circles in the blocks are activation functions.And if you check out carefully,you will observe that there are three type of weights.$W$ which are with input word vector, $W'$ is with RNN cell o/p and finally $W''$ is at the final RNN cell which helps to make the prediction.O/p of RNN cells are taken as an i/p for the next RNN cell,this is to keep the sequence information preserved. Now, $O_i$ is,\n\n> \\begin{equation}\n O_i = f(X_iW+O_iW')\n \\end{equation}\n\nAnd at the end, the output of the last RNN cell and the $W''$ are taken and passed through an activation function(here sigmoid is taken) to generate the prediction, $Y' = S(O_nW'')$. And rest of the things are taken care by backpropagation and gradient descent stuff, normal model training.\n<br>\n> Note, description of all symbols are given in the image itself."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Utils"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")                     #Ignoring unnecessory warnings\n\nimport numpy as np                                  #for large and multi-dimensional arrays\nimport pandas as pd                                 #for data manipulation and analysis\nimport nltk                                         #Natural language processing tool-kit\n\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords                   #Stopwords corpus\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer                 # Stemmer\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer          #For Bag of words\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer          #For TF-IDF\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec                                   #For Word2Vec\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import one_hot\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n\n","execution_count":43,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading Data Using Pandas:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npd.pandas.set_option('display.max_columns',None)\npd.pandas.set_option('display.max_rows',None)\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/amazon-fine-food-reviews/Reviews.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":1,"data":{"text/plain":"   Id   ProductId          UserId                      ProfileName  \\\n0   1  B001E4KFG0  A3SGXH7AUHU8GW                       delmartian   \n1   2  B00813GRG4  A1D87F6ZCVE5NK                           dll pa   \n2   3  B000LQOCH0   ABXLMWJIXXAIN  Natalia Corres \"Natalia Corres\"   \n3   4  B000UA0QIQ  A395BORC6FGVXV                             Karl   \n4   5  B006K2ZZ7K  A1UQRSCLF8GW1T    Michael D.

The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.<br /><br />I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.

I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThey are good but wish they were also baked. Have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere. If there are any I wish someone would post.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have \"just a touch.\"\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.<br />One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.<br /><br />We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.<br /><br />Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.<br /><br />We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.<br />These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThese chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nDon't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nDEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI love sour food but this one I can't bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I don't like it.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nUnless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called \"Vinegar and Sea Salt\" - not \"Sea Salt and Vinegar\".\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them.  The fact that i was able to find them on-line for such a great price, was wonderful.  I would definitely make the purchase again.  THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nUsed to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label \"yeast extract\".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThe chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nAfter waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nKettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nMy daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nTerrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nAfter reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!\n-----------------------------------------------------\nKettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThese chips taste awesome. And unlike most other flavored chips, they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip. Just don't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption. They'll totally know it was you.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nWith Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThese are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read \"Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!\"<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips.  I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same.  You've got to stick with this blue bag of chips!\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI bought these when on sale through Amazon.  Nice crispy thick chips.  Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nFor those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThis is a real good product.I love these chips and so does my customers can't go wrong wit these the best\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them. These are the only chips I eat\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nWhile I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nOnly 5mg sodium per serving, chips are crisp.  I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nI have found this product, Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous.  I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores.  They are crisp and tasty without all of the salt.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nWhen I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nSmiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThese are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nSalt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nPackage arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.<br /><br />The Product?<br /><br />These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had. You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.<br /><br />Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you love jalapeno chips then Kettle is a must try.<br />Nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapeno.<br />Delicious.<br />Addicting.<br />Recommended.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nMy son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .\n-----------------------------------------------------\nAfter looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThere is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The \"best by\" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThis is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!\n-----------------------------------------------------\nHow to achieve potato chip nirvana? It's simple:  Buy these chips, get them tomorrow, eat them!<br />Repeat.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Best \"old school\" BBQ flavor out there<br />Kettle quality<br />Incredible price with Amazon<br /><br />Did I mention delicious and a terrific bargain?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df3 = df2.head(50000)\ndf3.head()","execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":36,"data":{"text/plain":"                                                text  score\n0  I have bought several of the Vitality canned d...      5\n1  Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanut...      1\n2  This is a confection that has been around a fe...      4\n3  If you are looking for the secret ingredient i...      2\n4  Great taffy at a great price.

After that we are taking 100 layers of LSTM and feeding the output of Embedding leyer to each of the LSTM layer . Now, each of the `LSTM` layer will spit out a scaller value and then we will be stacking them out,because of that the output size after `LSTM` layer would be 100. Ten we againg perform a Dropout layer. At the end we have a single activation unit of `sigmoid` (line 8) which will take the 100 sized vector and give a prediction or in general words give a scaler value between 0 to 1. \n\nNow we are setting the optimixer as `adam` and evaluation matrics as `accurecy` and loss as `binary_crossentropy`(this is because we have taken this as a binary classification problem) using the `model.compile()` method.\nAt the 10th line we are printing the model architecture using `model.summary()` method."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Creating model\nembedding_vector_features=40\nmodel=Sequential()\nmodel.add(Embedding(voc_size,embedding_vector_features,input_length=sent_length))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.3))\nmodel.add(LSTM(100))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.3))\nmodel.add(Dense(1,activation='sigmoid'))\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',optimizer='adam',metrics=['accuracy'])\nprint(model.summary())","execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"Model: \"sequential\"\n_________________________________________________________________\nLayer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   \n=================================================================\nembedding (Embedding)        (None, 400, 40)           200000    \n_________________________________________________________________\ndropout (Dropout)            (None, 400, 40)           0         \n_________________________________________________________________\nlstm (LSTM)                  (None, 100)               56400     \n_________________________________________________________________\ndropout_1 (Dropout)          (None, 100)               0         \n_________________________________________________________________\ndense (Dense)                (None, 1)                 101       \n=================================================================\nTotal params: 256,501\nTrainable params: 256,501\nNon-trainable params: 0\n_________________________________________________________________\nNone\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some preprocessing before feeding the data.
